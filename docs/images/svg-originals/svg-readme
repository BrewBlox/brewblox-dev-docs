Work-in-Progress SVG standards for BrewPi documentation website

Inkscape settings:
Page margins: vector: 1pt (all sides), raster: none
Font: Roboto (Google android Font from repository: sudo apt install fonts-roboto)

- Markdown does not have native support for sizing images. This can be done in HTML. Currently image sizes are used as is or automatically resized (reduced) to line width upon load.
- Technical drawings originating from PDF are converted to SVG with Draw and modified in Inkscape
- Big SVG-files (i.e. from converted PDF files) are compressed with vecta.io/nano or https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/
    - vecta is more efficient for big files, but prone to errors (objects missing, quote (") in text is converted to &quot, maybe more...)
    - svgomg is less efficient, but reliable
- SVG uncompressed originals are stored in ..\svg-originals\ for future modification
- JPG files are exported in GIMP at 90% quality level
- full page width raster images are stored at 1200px width, 96 dpi


Workflow:
Vector: Create SVG (Inkscape) -> store original -> compress big svg's -> website
Raster: Create SVG (Inkscape) -> store original -> export jpg (GIMP) -> website
