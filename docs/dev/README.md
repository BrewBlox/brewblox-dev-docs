# Developer Documentation

Brewblox is a rapidly evolving system that welcomes external contributions. To reflect this, developer documentation is split in four subcategories:

**Tutorials** show how to create and run simple scripts. These are useful for everyone that wants to tinker with their own system. The source code for all tutorials is also available [here](https://github.com/brewblox/brewblox-tutorials).

**Contributing guides** describe how to get started building a service, and how to use dev tools.

**Reference documents** describe protocols and interfaces, and are updated whenever these change.

**Design decisions** are documents describing past research and the context for major decisions.
These are not updated: if a decision changes or is reversed, a new document is added. This ensures that not only the current state is known, but also the process that led us there.
